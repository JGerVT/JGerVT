All requirements for this software and course have been completed. 
### My Software incorporates:
- Persistent data between sessions (Save and Load JSON)
- Data Validation and Verification
- Reusable Code
- Code Documentation throughout

### This software includes:
- Images, Files, and Text can be placed, moved, and scaled on the canvas.
- The canvas can be panned and zoomed on
- Tabs to store multiple canvases.
- The ability to select and manipulate multiple canvas items at once.
- Copy, paste, delete and duplicate functionality for Canvas Items and Tabs.

### The future of this software:
This project will be continued and extended outside of this course, but the basic functionality has been completed.
Some features that still need to be added outside this course are:
- GUI database panel of all canvas items on the canvas
- Settings page to alter various aspects of the software
- Allow music files to be played from within the canvas
- Change the color of the dot for each tab
- Add a left sidebar to open projects using the top left hamburger button
